Hi all, my name is Jiaying Liang, an IT graduate from UNSW. Glad to be your demonstrator this term. There will be weekly group online meeting from week2 to week9 on every Wednesday 8:00-9:00pm. 

Attendance for our workshop is not compulsory, but I hope I can see you here since it's a great chance for you, your teammates and me to discuss our course and assignments here.

All the best with this term! 



My name is Yingbo Sun, an AI and mechanical graduate from UNSW, currently working as fire service engineer. Glad to be your demonstrator this term. As mentioned in week1's lecture, there will be weekly group meetings from week2 to week9 which I plan to schedule on Wednesday or Thursday evenings (Sydney time). Please fill in the poll below by **picking yourself a timeslot that fits every team member before 12pm Wednesday** so I can finalize the schedule for weekly meetings. Please give a thumb up to this post if you have read this. Wish we can have a good term and all get HD for this subject! 

 

Please make sure you only put your group number in one slot. Attendance will be noted but will only be considered if your contribution to group assignment is doubted. See you week 2 and all the best with this term! !
